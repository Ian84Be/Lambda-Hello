burger heaven

watching the whataburger machine gracefully accommodate
with pleasant style cushions matching tabletops
dull gold silver-gold
against black speckled vanilla plastic bench seating
everyone utilizes the restroom upon entering
it is clean-smelling
vanilla-gold grey static

we need a ranch please table service
24 hours day night daylight savings time paradox

old sauce is just mayonnaise
new sauce is thousand island
lettuce and tomato relatable

old man is puzzling crossword steam whistle
he clicks his pen closedÂ 
plaid shirt key rattling one last free soda before leaving
with his newspaper folded neatly beneath his armpit

juanita gave me two buckets of ketchup
but i only need one

i leave the unopened portion on the marbled acrylic tabletop
to faithfully await
the next consumer
