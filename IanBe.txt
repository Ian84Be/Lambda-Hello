good hat crowning the grey stranger

dark eyes hiding behind dark glasses
dark heart hiding behind dark scars
heavy hands learning a lighter touch
his mouth is filled with ribbons
that wrap the present moment
a rewarding gift
walking fast along a path
he can see without seeing
carving tracks into people that pass
subtle effect of atmosphere
studying changes
growing backwards into now
he writes a story to prove his life was spent living
sometimes he doesnâ€™t believe it himself.
